Version 1.1, 10/12/17
This Python file shows how to query results from table, 't', in database, 'af', stored on a local MySQL server while
importing the values directly into a Pandas dataframe.

The table lists details about pieces created by the custom furniture business, Artfully Functional,
with fields for ID, size type, year built, labor hours, materials cost, sale prices (wholesale or retail,
before or after sales tax) and potential profits. A second table, 'a', contains additional information and is
used to demonstrate queries indexing or joining multiple tables.
